## üí° Best Practices When Using Screenshots

2. **Use high resolution** - Take screenshots on highest res device available
3. **Show key features** - Capture moments that highlight unique functionality
4. **Good lighting** - Ensure maps are visible, text is readable
5. **Multiple angles** - Capture planning mode, navigation mode, different waypoint counts

### When Prompting:

2. **Reference specific elements** visible in your screenshot ("the waypoint timeline at top")
3. **Specify what to preserve** ("keep UI elements exactly as shown")
4. **Specify what to enhance** ("increase vibrancy", "add phone frame")
5. **Mention exact colors** if they should match screenshot precisely

### Output Optimization:
1. **Request specific dimensions** for each use case
2. **Ask for "high resolution" or "4K"** for marketing materials
